=head1 SYNOPSIS

  ~/perl/Some-Project$ tracker start
  Started working on Some-Project at 09:03:41

  ~/perl/Some-Project$ tracker stop
  Worked 00:07:42 on Some-Project

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<tracker> is the front end script to L<App::TimeTracker>. C<tracker>
allows you to easily track and report the time you spend on various
jobs, projects, tasks etc from the commandline.

Custom commands or adaptions to your workflow can be implemented via
an "interesting" set of L<Moose>-powered plugins. You can configure
different sets of plugins for different jobs or projects.

B<Tipp:> Use C<tracker plugins> to list all installed plugins. Read more about each plugin in C<App::TimeTracker::Command::PLUGIN-NAME>.

Currently, there are plugins to interact with RT (RequestTracker),
git and IRC. For example, the command

  tracker start --rt 1234

might (depending on the current configuration)

=over

=item * fetch the ticket subject from RT

=item * create a new git branch named after the ticket subject and check it out

=item * post a notification to your internal IRC channel, informing your colleagues that you're now working on that ticket

=item * tell you're window manager to display the current ticket in your taskbar

=item * and of course: store the time you started working on this ticket

=back

Each time you C<start> a new task, a so-called C<tracking file> will
be created. This file contains all information regarding the task
you're currently working on. If you call C<stop>, the current time is
stored into the C<tracking file> and the time spend working on this
task is calculated (and also stored).

All C<tracking files> are plain text files containing JSON. It is very
easy to synchronize them on different machines, using anything from
rsync to version control systems. Or you just can use the
C<SyncViaGit> plugin!

=head1 CONFIG FILES

The first time you use C<tracker>, it will create a directory named
F<.TimeTracker> in your home directory (provided by L<File::HomeDir).
This directory will contain your master config file F<tracker.json>
and all C<tracking files>.

You can override and ammend your default configuration by creating a
project specific config file named F<.tracker.json> in your project
directory.

B<Tipp:> Use C<tracker init> to create an empty config file in the
current working directory.

All C<.tracker.json> files found in your current working
directory and all its parent are merged into one configuration.

Example:

  ~/.TimeTracker/tracker.json
  ~/job/.tracker.json
  ~/job/project/.tracker.json

If you hit C<start> in F<~/job/project/>, all three of those config
files will be merged and the resulting hash will be used as the
current configuration. 

If you hit C<start> in F<~/job/>, only F<~/job/.tracker.json> and C<~/.TimeTracker/tracker.json> will be used.

This allows you to have global default settings, different default
setting for different jobs, and finetuned settings for each project.
Of course you can have as many levels of configs as you want.

B<Tipp:> Use C<tracker show_config> to dump the current configuration.

=head1 TRACKING FILES

A C<tracking file> contains all information about one interval you
worked on one task. The data is provided by
L<App::TimeTracker::Data::Task> and stored in JSON via
L<MooseX::Storage>.

C<tracking files> are stored in F<~/.TimeTracker> in a directory
hierarchy consisting of the current year and the current month. This
makes it easy (easier..) to find a specific C<tracking file> in case
you need to make some manual corrections (an interface for easier
editing of C<tracking files> is planned).

The filename of a C<tracking file> looks like
'YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_$project.trc', for example:
F<20110811-090437_App_TimeTracker.trc>.

There are three special files in F<~/.TimeTracker>:

=over

=item * F<current>

This file contains the filename of the currently active C<tracking file>. If you're not working on anything at the moment, this file does not exist.

=item * F<previous>

This file contains the filename of the last active C<tracking file>.

=item * F<projects.json>

This file contains a JSON hash listing all the projects and their
config files that you used. Currently it is not used, but we will need
it shortly to make the reports nicer. Using this file, we can find all
projects that are time-tracked, without having to traverse your whole
filesystem.
